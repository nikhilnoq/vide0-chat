How It Works
<br>
ZEGOCLOUD SDK Integration: The app integrates the ZEGOCLOUD SDK for real-time video communication.
<br>
Room Management: Users can create a room by entering a unique room ID. This ID can be shared with others who can use it to join the room.
<br>
Peer-to-Peer Communication: Once users join the same room, they can see and hear each other using their devices' cameras and microphones.
