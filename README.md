Video Chat App
This is a video chat application built with React and powered by the ZEGOCLOUD SDK. It allows users to create or join video rooms for seamless, real-time video communication.

Features
Create/Join Rooms: Users can create new video rooms or join existing ones.
Real-time Video and Audio: Stream real-time video and audio with other participants in the room.
Mute/Unmute: Option to mute/unmute audio during the video chat.
Video On/Off: Ability to toggle the video on and off.
End Call: Ability to leave the room and end the call.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v12.x or higher)
npm or yarn
A ZEGOCLOUD account and API key

How It Works
ZEGOCLOUD SDK Integration: The app integrates the ZEGOCLOUD SDK for real-time video communication.
Room Management: Users can create a room by entering a unique room ID. This ID can be shared with others who can use it to join the room.
Peer-to-Peer Communication: Once users join the same room, they can see and hear each other using their devices' cameras and microphones.
